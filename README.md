# Logistic Map Analysis

## Bifurcation Diagram Notebook
The notebook "Bifurcation_Diagram.ipynb" contains the code and analysis for generating the bifurcation diagram of the logistic map. 

## Lyapunov Exponents Notebook
In the "Lyapunov_Exponents.ipynb" notebook, you'll find the code and analysis related to the calculation of Lyapunov exponents for the logistic map. This provides insights into the system's chaos and stability.
